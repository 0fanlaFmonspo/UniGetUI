The main goal of this project is to create a GUI Store for the most common CLI package managers for Windows, such as Winget and Scoop. 

From here, you'll be able to download, install, upgrade and uninstall any software published on Winget or Scoop.

AppGet was supported in release 0.3, but since that project has been discontinued, the support has been removed.

This project has no connection to the official Winget-CLI project - it's completely unofficial.

 - Support for managing Scoop buckets.
 - The user can select the version that should be installed for any of the apps.
 - The user will be notified whether the installation/upgrade/uninstallation was completed successfully or not.
 - The ability to queue installations in order to prevent conflicts.
 - A dark theme is available to prevent you from burning your eyes. :)
 - The ability to show some package-related information (like license, SHA256 hash, homepage, etc.) before installing.
 - 5800+ packages available to install, such as Google Chrome, WhatsApp, Adobe Reader or ADB Tools!
 - More features are coming!
