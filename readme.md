The main goal of this project is to give a GUI Store to the most common CLI Package Managers for windows, such as Winget and Scoop. From here you'll be able to download, install upgrade and uninstall any software published on winget or on scoop.
Appget was supported on release 0.3 but as it was discontinued it has been removed.
This project has no connection with the winget-cli official project, and it's totally unofficial.
# Features
 - Ability to install packages from scoop and from winget (The idea is to add more package managers in a future)
 - Ability to install scoop and winget if they aren't installed on user's machine.
 - Smooth and responside UI (starting from v0.4)
 - It has winget embedded, so it is not needed to install winget manually
 - Support for `scoop bucket add extras`
 - User can choose which version to install (if more than one version is available)
 - Detects whether the installation suceeded or not
 - Provides error information in case of installation failure
 - Ability to queue installations in order to prevent conflicts
 - Dark theme available to prevent you from burning your eyes :)
 - Ability to show some package-related information (license, sha256, homepage, etc.)
 - More than 4700 packages available to install, such as Google Chrome, Whatsapp, Adobe Reader or ADB Tools!
