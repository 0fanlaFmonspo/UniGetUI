# WinGet UI: Give WinGet a proper Graphical interface
The main goal of this project is to give a GUI to the new WinGet CLI package manager.
This project has no connection with the winget-cli official project, and it's totally unofficial.

# Installation
For the moment, there are no packages available. Python 3.9 is required. You'll need to clone the repository, install requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and run `__init__.py` from the wingetui folder.

I'll add a .exe package soon :)
