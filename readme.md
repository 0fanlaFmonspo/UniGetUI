# WingetUI Store: Give Windows 10 a proper (Graphical) User Interface to install packages from most common CLI package managers such as Winget or Scoop.
The main goal of this project is to give a GUI Store to the most common CLI Package Managers for windows, such as Winget and Scoop.
This project has no connection with the winget-cli official project, and it's totally unofficial.

#Features
 - Ability to install packages from scoop and from winget (The idea is to add more package managers in a future)
 - Ability to install scoop and winget if they aren't installed on user's machine.
 - User can choose which version to install (if more than one version is available)
 - Detects whether the installation suceeded or not
 - Provides error information in case of installation failure
 - Ability to queue installations in order to prevent conflicts
 - Dark theme available to prevent you from burning your eyes :)
 - Ability to show some package-related information (license, sha256, homepage, etc.)
 - More than 2800 packages available to install, such as Google Chrome, Whatsapp, Adobe Reader or ADB Tools!
 - More features coming!


# Installation
For the moment, there are no packages available. Python 3.9 is required. You'll need to clone the repository, install requirements.txt (`pip install -r requirements.txt`) and run `__init__.py` from the wingetui folder.

I'll add a .exe package soon :)
